# RemoveSpotifyAds
It mutes the spotify audio when an advert begins and unmute it when the ad finishes.


In order to make the code work, you'll need to:

  1. have chrome installed.
  2. install chrome webdriver program (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
  3. install the selenium module by opening the terminal and writing "pip install selenium".
  4. write down in the "credenziali.py" file the username and password of your spotify account.
  
Enjoy the music without ads... :)
